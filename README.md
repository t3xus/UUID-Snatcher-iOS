## **UUID Snatcher**

### **Overview**
UUID Snatcher is an iOS application designed to:
- Scan for Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) with names containing **"Juice"**.
- Allow users to select and connect to the desired AP.
- Fetch a UUID by accessing `http://10.10.10.1/command/get+system.uuid`.
- Persist previously processed APs to avoid redundant connections.

---

### **Features**
- **Wi-Fi Scanning**: Lists all APs with names containing "Juice."
- **AP Selection**: Users can pick specific APs to connect to.
- **UUID Fetching**: Fetches the UUID from the AP’s HTTP interface.
- **Email Integration**: Automatically sends the UUID to a support email.
- **Persistence**: Skips APs previously processed by saving them locally.

### **How It Works**

1. **Wi-Fi Scanning**: 
   - The app scans for APs containing "Juice" in their SSID.
   - Skips networks previously processed.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Displays a list of matching networks.
   - Allows the user to select an AP to connect to.

3. **Connection & UUID Fetch**:
   - The app connects to the selected AP using **NEHotspotConfiguration**.
   - Fetches the UUID from the AP’s endpoint `http://10.10.10.1/command/get+system.uuid`.

4. **Email Automation**:
   - Emails the UUID to `support@voltiegroup.com`.

5. **Persistence**:
   - The app saves previously processed APs in `UserDefaults` to avoid reprocessing.
